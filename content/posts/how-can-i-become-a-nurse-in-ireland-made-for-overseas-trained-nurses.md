## How can I become a nurse in Ireland (Made for overseas trained nurses)

- - -

Yes, you came here looking for information. Information pertaining to nursing registration and finding a job in Ireland.

**If you belong to this category you can read on.**

I am trying to write down all the information as simple as possible, all in one place.

**The first and foremost step is to get your Nursing registration with NMBI.**  Detailed information about the same is available from NMBI.

But I know, you might be looking for a simpler version of this document. Let’s break it even further.

Towards your NMBI registration.

A. Get your English Language requirement sorted!

There are three categories of applicants.

Group -1 & 2: Nurses rained as a general nurse or midwife in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA)

\
Group 3- Nurses trained outside the EU.

No matter what group you belong to, From 2 April 2018, applicants for registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland who have qualifications from outside of Ireland must now satisfy the Board that they have the necessary knowledge of English to communicate effectively in their practice.

Any applicants who completed their preregistration course or who have practised as an RN in the following country do not need to write an English Language exam.

* Australia
* Canada
* New Zealand 
* The United States of America
* United Kingdom

So in a Nutshell, if you have not trained or worked as an RN in any of the above countries, you will need to write an English Language Test.

### An important point to remember

Do not apply for registration until you meet the minimum scores under the IELTS Academic Test/OET . If you make an application and don’t meet the English language competency requirements, the assessment fee is non-refundable

### Get your Application pack from NMBI

Now that you have met the language competency, the next step is to apply for an initial registration pack. Visit  NMBI to get your Overseas Registration Application Request Form.

This form requires you to provide:

* Personal contact details
* Division(s) of the Register
* Your TRF number, for Group 3 applicants only
* Details of your Debit/Credit Card so that the assessment fee may be deducted 

### Overseas Registration Application Pack

Once the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) processes your Overseas Registration Application Request Form and the assessment fee, you will be issued with an Overseas Registration Application Pack. You need to read and follow all the instructions within this pack carefully to avoid unnecessary delays in processing your application. This is very important.

There are Mainly two sections in this application form.

* Section -1 needs to be completed by you, the applicant.
* Section-2 needs to be completed by relevant authorities.

At this, you will receive how to create your account with NMBI web. This will enable tracking of the progress of the application.

**The key thing to do** – Get all your papers ready as fast as you can. NMBI works on the papers on first come first serve basis, and they will not start an assessment until all your papers are in. 

### Assessment and Outcome

Once all your papers are in, then NMBI will assess and will give you an outcome within 90 days. The decision could be

1. You get your PIN (Extreme rare for Non-EU trained cases)
2. Do and adaptation or Aptitude test to complete registration.

## Adaptation or Aptitude

   The next big step is to find an employer who is willing to give you a job to complete adaptation or to write an aptitude test conducted by RCSI.

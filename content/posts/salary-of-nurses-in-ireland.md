## Salary of Nurses in Ireland

This blog explores the salary of nurses in Ireland. This also focuses on average take-home pay after tax.

### Salary of Pre-registered Nurses and Adaptation (candidate) nurses

A newly qualified staff nurse or midwife, that is a nurse who has finished college, but has yet to be registered under the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), would start on an annual salary of around ***€26,679***
This is the same case with nurses doing the adaptation. Overseas nurses doing adaptation is considered pre-reg nurses or candidate nurses in a public hospital and they are also given the above salary.

After-tax, that amounts to around ***€23,188***, or a net monthly income of around €1,932. If it is broken down to weekly wages, that is in the region of €12.38 per hour after tax.

However, pre-reg nurses will move on to the registered nurses' salary scale once they have the NMBI PIN number.  

### Salary of Registered Staff Nurses in Ireland

A registered staff nurse’s salary in Ireland starts at €31,109. After-tax, it will be around €26,356 per year or €2,196 per month, For a 39-hour working week, a nurse at the bottom of the ladder would be getting around €14.07 per hour after tax.

The above is the first point of the scale in the salary of nurses in Ireland. This scale can reach a high of €47,931 in yearly increments (after 10 years).

Please note, the above figures are indicative. If you are working for HSE, there will be more taken from your pay (for pension). For someone earning 36.5 K, the average pension deduction will be € 145 per month.

Nurses who come from overseas with experience will be placed on the correct scale once they finish adaptation.

For example, A nurse with 5-year experience when coming to Ireland they earn €24,850/year during their adaptation. However, when they get their NMBI PIN, they will be on the 5th scale of pay. ie € 36,696.

***Enhance Practice Scale***

There was a nursing strike in 2019 to improve pay conditions for Nurses. To put it in a nutshell, there were a couple of changes to nurses' pay. 

1. Nurses on the 4th point of scale get an option to move on to the first point of the enhanced practice contract. The salary starts from **€37,661** and reach up to **€49,486** ( 8 scales) 
2. Expansion of Location Qualification Allowance ( Annual) to other areas

   * €2371 for working in medical and surgical areas
   * € 3561 for having a specialist qualification such as a higher diploma or master's and working in a specialist area.

In an essence, most of the nurses would be eligible to get either one of these. Both of these allowances will not be given simultaneously. You get the higher one. 

***Premiums and allowances***

A night duty premium of time + ¼ (hourly rate) is payable to nurses/midwives rostered for night duty on a rotational basis. Night duty is normally defined as hours worked between 8 pm and 8 am.
